# Card Beat Prototype

A minimal Godot 4.2 prototype combining card interactions with beat-reactive visuals and simple synth audio.

## Features
- Clickable UI cards that play procedural sine wave tones.
- Particle effects triggered when cards are used.
- Timer-based beat events that drive simple scale animations.
- Placeholder procedural audio generation using `AudioStreamGenerator`.

## Running on macOS with Godot 4.2
1. Install [Godot 4.2](https://godotengine.org/download) for macOS.
2. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://example.com/codex_godot_game_card_music.git
   ```
3. Open Godot, choose **Import/Scan** and select the project folder.
4. Run the project (press **F5**) to see the prototype in action.

This project is an MVP intended for experimentation and can be expanded into a full card-based rogue-like rhythm game.
